# Home Assistant Dashboard

Welcome! This repository contains my Home Assistant dashboard configurations and assets.

Several people have asked to see my setup, so I'm excited to share what I’ve built so far.  
I hope it inspires or helps you with your own smart home dashboard!

## How to Use

1. **Install all required components** listed in the [Components Used](#components) section below.
2. **Create a new dashboard from scratch** in Home Assistant.
3. **Replace the dashboard code**:
   - Open the newly created dashboard in YAML mode.
   - Copy the contents of `dashboard.yaml` from this repository and paste it into your dashboard.

4. **Expect errors at first** — you'll likely see a lot of red warnings.  
   Don’t worry! That’s expected. These appear because my entity IDs don’t match yours.

5. **Customize it for your setup**:
   - Replace all of my entity IDs (e.g., `person.richard`, `light.kitchen_ceiling`) with your own.
   - Make adjustments as needed to match your devices and preferences.

6. **Verify all custom components are installed** and working properly to ensure everything runs smoothly.
